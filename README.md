# Storybooks App

This repository is part the "Creating a Node.js App" tutorial by Brad Traversy. The tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBvmnHTQIPY





## Changes to the tutorial
* I decided to expand on this project by using EJS instead of handlebars. 
* Instead of using the moment package to handle dates, I decided to use the built in Javascript API
* My next step after finishing this project is to create the front end using React Router.
