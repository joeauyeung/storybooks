# Storybooks App

This repository is part the "Creating a Node.js App" tutorial by Brad Traversy. The tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBvmnHTQIPY





## Changes to the tutorial
* In the beginning I decided to expand on this project by using EJS instead of handlebars. 
* I am now recreating the front end using React and React router. I am also using Material UI instead of Materialize-css
* Instead of using the moment package to handle dates, I decided to use the built in Javascript API
